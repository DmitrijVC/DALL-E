# DALL-E
A simple app using an exploit in a third-party service in order to allow for unlimited text-to-image generations using DALL-E ai model.

This will get patched very quickly, so use while you can!

### How to use?
1. Go to the releases
2. Download the newest version
3. Run the application

### How does it work?
It's a Tauri application that loads a third-party service and modifies its behaviour.

### Why scripts are obfuscated?
Devs are looking for new exploits and patch them quickly. This gives you time to use this exploit for as long as possible.

### Why not to inject the scrips in the browser?
It won't work, using the Tauri API gives us ability to do things that would not be allowed on your regular browser.

### Note
I am not sure if the third-party service is using DALL-E or any other model and idc really ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
